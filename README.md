This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Cloudflare deployment

This app deploys as a Cloudflare Worker through Vinext. Configure these variables in Cloudflare Pages under **Settings > Environment variables** for the active deployment environment, before deploying:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

Configure `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` as a Cloudflare secret, never as a committed `vars` value:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

Do not use `wrangler secret put` for the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values: those secrets are runtime-only and are not available to the Cloudflare build command. The `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values must be available during `npm run build:vinext` because the browser bundle and prerender step need them at build time. After changing Cloudflare variables, run a new build and deploy.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
